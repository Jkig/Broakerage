DONE:
/*
add bitcoin as a card
instead of a massive list, transition into a single hard coded map, can do things like superMap['chosesubmaphere']['acces instance in submap here']//1
    //create new project for above?
        //not neccisary
pass map into fullstock page (EZ)
add changing cash position page

Get percentages n shit to map
get a net worth pie chart going
USD worth invested in each (ez)
Pass initial quantity into fullstock and still be able to buy/sell

can reskin to look a bit more like the wealthtracker app

New/better and more random and more different graphs

update what "account" we are in visually
update what "time frame" we are in visually
make cash amout work with all the same update shit as two above
        // globaler variables>?




update quantity in home etc. to reflect bought/sold quantity
    //perhaps can Pass an optional map in, if it is passed into loading, then the shit is updated as this comes from full stock and purchase may have been made.
    //something like massing an object with ticker and delta quantity, then using to update quantity, or potentially using global variables??
    //perhaps file io?
    //also do the same for cash


get the bottomNavigationBar to work


Get graphs working!!
just find annother api man, historic
    //shouldn't be too hard
    https://www.alphavantage.co/

Then make it track net worth somehow, pehaps saving data locally!
release new app






Do these to get through this shit!!

Asking for help with:
Also probably similar is updating the button colors from clicking
getting the bottomnavigationbar to work
how would i get graphs to be legit, this is silly lol. can be very generall,  i just want an idea, do i run a server or like an api from my pc?
How to add new stocks from within the app, can be more generall //(have a bit ready to get example...)//error handling later


guesses on problems for updating the quantity
the value may be good, but needs to refresh/redraw
I may have redefined a copy, and its showing

//git repository
branches
and good to share
//aka do it


json is a format, look at this...
read back out as a json pot.

/perhaps child widget in ros/column can be statefull, and that can be used

make the cards statefull/ wraped in statefull

try seccond to get quant to update
look at inherited widgets
(home would be inherited)




not quant-> list->
/update seccond
I'm updating quant, but the quant never used when popping back to home, list is, and noot just list, but a copy, qould havbe t mess areound somewhere
