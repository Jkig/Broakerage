Get graphs working
// Simple line graphs in fileio test app,
// Pull in some actual stock data with an api and graph, all testing here in prob 1 app
// add to real app,
// perhaps pull away the infrastructure that pulls current price


pass neccisary data into profile widget


just find annother api man, historic
    https://www.alphavantage.co/
    https://iexcloud.io/pricing/
        https://pub.dev/packages/finance_quote // Current api for current prices




chop off a bunch of shit to make a net worth at instand app, and get started with releasing it
Then make it track net worth somehow, pehaps saving data locally!




//// later:
add a stock of your choice!!!?
get different time graphs from different time periods


Chat with skylar:
Chat a lil personally
show around a lil
talk about eye tracking reading shit, show him my idea of how to get there first, and if that's a good path,
a little guidance on how to get through it
where are all these avaid empty statemets from( its all the same logic, a copied thing...
probably getting profile to work
//??overhaul to get it where i could add new stocks within the app?? perhaps not as hard as i think, there are only 2-3 places things are coded "dumbly"
//??but there are other parts where things may beed to be done different, like the global variable, although that can be pushed within session...


Get done first:
    // probably the graphs for each stock, this will be nice, may take a long time though.
