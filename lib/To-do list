Get graphs working
// take in list of doubles ("prices") and put into lines
// Pull in some actual stock data with an api and graph, all testing here in prob 1 app
// add to real app,
// perhaps pull away the infrastructure that pulls current price so i dont have to pull from both apis
    //althrough with async it may not add much time if any


Start writing algorithm to offset risk, or at least infrastructure to test some, probably all in python?***


just find another api man, historic
    https://www.alphavantage.co/
    https://iexcloud.io/pricing/
// https://pub.dev/packages/finance_quote // Current api for current prices



chop off a bunch of shit to make a net worth at instant app, and get started with releasing it
Then make it track net worth somehow, perhaps saving data locally!
perhaps keep data and store account by acccount



//// later:
add a stock of your choice!!!?



Chat with skylar:
Chat a lil (lol if you see this m8 its because i can get a little excited and jump in, although a i wanna chat, and b that is rude)
show around a lil
first getting pynput working on my mac
talk about eye tracking reading shit, show him my idea of how to get there first, and if that's a good path,
    a little guidance on how to get through it
// it said too much work on main thread skipped x frames (usually 64, but recently 174+ until in changed it, obvi push is worse than what i did but explain please?
    where are all these avoid empty statements from( its all the same logic, a copied thing...
get a little guidance on my hedging stratagy algo, idk where i'll be at that time
//some help connecting the alpha vantage api to this...
//??overhaul to get it where i could add new stocks within the app?? perhaps not as hard as i think, there are only 2-3 places things are coded "dumbly"
//??but there are other parts where things may need to be done different, like the global variable, although that can be pushed within session...
// holy shit i'm getting close, I wanted a front end to get my ideas across, (and a little bit of theory) and now i'm close!

Get done first:
// add slide to complete and a quick (and fake async ie pre-timed) load screen for trade and cash change confirms
// try to get git to work
// probably the graphs for each stock, this will be nice, may take a long time though.
// obviously upload current version


Reading app plan:
First get an app where the mouse can move around, and a tracer is made (perhaps fades) in a window.
connect eye tracking to do the exact same.
display a paragraph.
see which sentence you are in and underline.
now we can experiment with different ways of showing text so one can read faster.
